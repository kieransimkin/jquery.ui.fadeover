 * Make an easy way to have the mouseover div identical to the normal div but with one extra CSS class
 * Allow the initial contents of this.element to be used for the normal div 
 * It'd be nice to be able to use Faceover as a drop-in replacement for the standard UI button widget. This would probably be fairly easy - a wrapper function.
 * It'd also be nice to be able to use FadeOver in place of the :hover CSS on all the standard UI widgets
