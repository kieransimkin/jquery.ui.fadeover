 * It'd be nice to be able to use Faceover as a drop-in replacement for the standard UI button widget. This would probably be fairly easy - a wrapper widget
 * It'd also be nice to be able to use FadeOver in place of the :hover CSS on all the standard UI widgets
 * Destroy and refresh are implemented, but don't work perfectly. In particular, destroy leaves inline styles on the element
 * Support no animations during autosizing
 * Autosizing doesn't always get the correct size
 * Using an anchor tag as a fadeover results in yucky dotted borders
 * Support "selected" state, with behaviour identical to the "disabled" state, to allow people to do menus properly
